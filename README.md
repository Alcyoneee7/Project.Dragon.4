First Of All, *This Project Is Hard.... Hard.... Very Very Hard.....* , I Rather Slain A Dragon With Toothpick Than Redo This .

I Almost Want To Give Up This Web Scraping Skill. I Encounter Many Problems And Stress While Doing This,

# Web Scraping Journey:

15. I Waste So Many Hour And Day, I Think Of Giving Up , I Mean .... Web Scraping Skill Is Not Really That Necessary Right?
16. Whatever I Go Again, Debug My Code. Go TO STACKOVERFLOW And Yes Finally It Works
17. Turnout I Have To Use time.sleep, To Make It Works And IT WORKS!!!! HOLY SH!!!TTTT
18. After It Was Done, I Scrap It..
19. Some Of The Text I Scrap Have Many Problem. I Have To Strip,Replace. There Also Null In Data, Because Of That Error **(10)** Again
20. I Write If Find Null, Then 0 Or Empty But It Doesn't Work, Have To Write IF Null Then "".
21. After Everything Is Done, Have To Import TO CSV. 
22. ERROR AGAIn **(11)** , There Only 1 Data And It The Last Data . 
23. Check It , After That Turnout My Program Rewrite Again And Again, Change IT TO 'w' To 'a'
24. AND YEAH ITS DONE, Is What I Thought. But There Are Problems In CSV
25. There Are So Many Comma, I Cannot Delimit Using Comma Otherwise ERROR **(12)**
26. Change The Delimiter AND FINALLY ITS DONE, But I Have To Change The Url Everytime I Write The Program
27. I Check On The Internet, How To Scrap Multiple Page And Yeah I Manage To Do It.
28. THEN IT WAS DONE

NEXT PROBLEM IN SQL.
This SQL PROBLEM ALSO VERY HARD....

# SQL JOURNEY:

2. Problem Encounter: There Are Some Data I Have To Add Zero In The Behind
3. Gross Have $ And M . Trim it...
4. Movie Out Of Range, Only Need (2018-2020)
5. Address The Problem And Solution, Want To Know Which Genre have Most Votes, Gross, Top Movies .. etc
6. Another Problem Again, I Need To Split The Genre Into 1,2,3 . Sum All The Genre And Count The Distinct 
7. DONE



# LAST PART
The Last Part Is The Easiest And Relaxing. I Do Import The Data To Tableau Public And Making Visualizations.

I Was Able To Make More Beautiful Dashboard And I Also Have The Chance To Try On Another Chart .

I Change The Font Type,Size,Pane, Everything To Better Itself.


# RESULT

Result In Dashboard, Tableau Public:

# Summary
I Was Able To Learn So Many Things In This Project, SOOOOO MUCHH. How TO Scrap Website, How To Import Into Csv, Advanced Technique In SQL. Etc

I Can Scrap My Own Data, Which Is Very Good Things To Have. I Also Got More Comfortable In SQL, Using INNER Join,Union ,CAST


# GOAL
In This Project, I Spend 2 Weeks To Get My Project Done. Which For Me Very Long. But I Gain Many Skill In The Process Of Doing So.

I Already Can Web Scraping, Next Should Be Practice Into Perfecting My Web Scraping Technique, Machine Learning, Also Learn Analyst Skill.

I Think I Also Should Learn To Visualization In Excel.
